youBot world and build library for v-rep
=============


Introduction
------------------
This package only contains a prebuild version of the library available at: https://github.com/mfueller/vrep_youbot_plugin
And additionally a scene file with lua scripts to build a youbot_oodl compatible environment. I don't claim any copyright i just want to make the first steps of simulating the youbot in v-rep as easy as possible to people who are interested in industrial robotics.


Usage
------------------
 * copy "libv_repExtyouBot.so" to your v-rep folder
 * execute the "vrep_youbot.launch" of the vrep_youbot_plugin package
 * start v-rep and open the *.ttt file


Dependencies
------------------
* ROS-Environment
* vrep_youbot_plugin
